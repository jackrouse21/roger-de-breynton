"As you wake from your Brode Street home, you pull on your boots and set about on your celebratory stroll, you can’t help but feel like things are a little bit different today. You haven’t been back in Hereford long, but already you can tell it will never be the same city to you again. You laugh at the years spent, eyes fixed on the city walls, scything, gleaning, and dreaming your way inside, but now that you had seen Oxford—Hereford wasn’t much. But still, it's home and it’s nice to be back.

"This year has taken a lot out of you. Spending hours poring over documents as the executor of Richard Swinfield’s estate served as a much needed distraction. But, the harsh reality of the recent years’ famine intrudes at any chance. 

You had never gone hungry, but the same couldn’t be said for others from Canon’s Moor. Though you know you have been a diligent reeve, clerk, and student, there must have been some luck involved. Why did God save me and not those who stayed to work the land? Why mother, who gave everything, when Thomas Talbot has never had to pick his own apple? These are questions Richard could have answered and knowing that slows your step as you reach Friar’s gate. The smiths of Bewell Street are not yet out making their din, the prostitutes of Grope Lane lie sleeping as do the cooks on Cooken Lane.

"The overwhelming smell of dirt hits your nose outside of the city walls. You toe the ground over which your life’s story has played out. How might things have been different had you grown up closer to Chirchebreynton’s rich floodplain meadows and not this fickle moor soil?

"In your reflective silence, you’re almost able to see the land for all its life and beauty instead of a mosaic of owned and accounted for investments.

"Yet that’s why you’re here in the first place: to buy land. The poor fortune of Thomas de Bromfeld has allowed you to grow your estate in ithin the Hereford city walls. But can you say you deserved it? You look to your left and scoff at Ralph’s stunted wheat amidst Werhameshelde. You read the books, that Ralph refused. As if reading Walter Henley was fun, but look at where it got us.

"You pause at “us,” remembering who “us” once was. That is why you’re really here: to remember. You put your hand on the yew tree where mother would wait for you after a day spent splashing about the Wye with Ralph. The feeling you had this morning returns--progress, the sensation that you’re building towards something special. While the memories of the yew tree may be all your mother could leave behind, you think perhaps you’re destined for something else. That maybe you will be remembered.
